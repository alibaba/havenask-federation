/**
 * Lambda expression node.
 * <p>
 * This can currently only be the direct argument of a call (method/constructor).
 * When the argument is of a known type, it uses
 * <a href="http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/lambda/lambda-translation.html">
 * Java's lambda translation</a>. However, if its a def call, then we don't have
 * enough information, and have to defer this until link time. In that case a placeholder
 * and all captures are pushed onto the stack and folded into the signature of the parent call.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <br>
 * {@code def list = new ArrayList(); int capture = 0; list.sort((x,y) -> x - y + capture)}
 * <br>
 * is converted into a call (pseudocode) such as:
 * <br>
 * {@code sort(list, lambda$0, capture)}
 * <br>
 * At link time, when we know the interface type, this is decomposed with MethodHandle
 * combinators back into (pseudocode):
 * <br>
 * {@code sort(list, lambda$0(capture))}
